# CCi-Assessment


### Question 1 has 2 different queries for the purpose of illustrating same result as requested.
### Please note that the assessment_date has been converted to a SQL DATE data type
	*** In my Local Machine SQL DB this is how client-column appears in my table as "ï»¿client"
	*** Should your DB data type be DATE data-type you will receive the same results, where after March-31-2018 we have 40 clients and 2599 assessments conducted 

    *** Please find the Folder (Images) with visual representation of the DB Structure and outputs
